Initial read through of the task, is mostly clear. The uncertain parts are mainly around how I would like to implement this to make it as simple as possible for the user to reproduce it. The questions that come to mind:

- What should the repository look like? Is remote allowed? If not, what does creating CI/CD locally look like?
- Config-as-Code? I think it makes sense, reminds me of examples like policy as code in OPA.
- Python implementation is a little intimidating, due to the lack of pythons lib ecosystem but seems simple enough to overcome and nothing some docs on google cant fix.
